# SVM_Framework
This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine for breast cancer detection using Sklearn. The code automatically downloads the data from Sklearn and creates two separate models using the default hyperparameters and a second iteration with a new value of “C” and a new kernel. To run it, it’s just necessary to have the following libraries: 
•	Numpy
•	Sklearn
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
